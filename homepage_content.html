                <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                    <p>You set a check-in interval (e.g., every 30 days). If you miss a check-in, we'll send you reminders. If you don't respond to the reminders, the system will automatically grant access to your designated contacts.</p>

                <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                    <p>Yes. All your documents are encrypted. We use industry-standard security practices to protect your data. Only the people you grant access to will ever be able to see your documents, and only after the Dead Man's Switch is triggered.</p>
